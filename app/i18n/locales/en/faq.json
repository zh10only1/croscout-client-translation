Each guest must be individually recorded with the relevant details, which can conveniently be done online via e-vistor. It is also important to note that the state imposes a flat-rate annual tax per bed offered in the property.",
    "184": "For those who have their primary residence outside Croatia, there are some tax specifics to consider. As a non-resident, you are required to provide a VAT identification number for categorization. This means that the rental must be conducted through a company rather than an individual. The annual turnover is crucial for determining the business form and the associated taxation. It is advisable to research all tax aspects in advance and seek professional advice if necessary to ensure compliance with all legal requirements."
